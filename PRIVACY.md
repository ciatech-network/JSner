# Privacy Policy
## Introduction
This privacy policy outlines how your data is handled when you use the [Your Extension Name] browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy while providing you with a useful and secure tool.

## Information We Collect
Our extension does not collect any personal information from you. The extension operates entirely within the browser and only accesses the content of the currently active tab when you choose to interact with it.

The only data that might be temporarily used or processed are:

URLs/Paths extracted from the JavaScript files and HTML content of the active tab.
Local results (URLs/Paths) generated by analyzing the content of the current page and the external resources it loads.
We do not collect any data outside of the functionality described in this Privacy Policy. The information is only processed locally within your browser.

## How We Use Your Data
The data collected (URLs/Paths) is used solely for the purpose of displaying and providing useful information to you. Specifically, we use this data to:

Extract and display URLs and paths from JavaScript files and HTML content.
Present the results in a user-friendly interface (modal) for your review.
Allow you to download the extracted URLs/Paths in a text file for further analysis.
Data Storage
No data is stored externally or permanently. All processing happens locally on your device. The extracted URLs/Paths are only available during your current session and are discarded once the extension is closed or the page is navigated away from.

## Data Sharing
We do not share any data or personally identifiable information with third parties. The extension works entirely within your browser, and no information is sent to any remote servers or external services.

## Permissions
To provide the features of this extension, we request the following permissions:

activeTab: This allows the extension to interact with the active tab and execute code to extract URLs and paths.
scripting: This permission allows the extension to inject JavaScript code into the active tab to analyze the content and extract the necessary data.
tabs: This permission helps the extension identify the active tab so it can perform the required actions.
Host Permissions (http:/// and https:///): These permissions allow the extension to access resources (e.g., JavaScript files) hosted on any HTTP/HTTPS domain. This is required to fetch and analyze content from external sources linked in the page.
## Security
We take your privacy seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your data. However, since all processing is done locally within your browser, the risk of data interception or misuse is minimal.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make significant changes to this policy, we will update the date at the top of the policy and notify users through appropriate means.
