## Documentation Guidelines

- **Do NOT create unnecessary markdown files** in the project root
- Stick to the main **README.md** for project documentation
- Any additional markdown files (if absolutely required) should be created under the `.cursor/` directory
- Keep the project root clean and organized
- Only create documentation when explicitly requested by the user
